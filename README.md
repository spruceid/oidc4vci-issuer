# OIDC4VCI Demo Issuer

This is an example issuer built with [`rocket`][] and [`oidc4vci-rs`][].

## Endpoints and support

Credential types supported:
  - [x] JWT
  - [ ] JSONLD

Endpoints available:

- `GET /`: to access a pre-authorized code in QRCode or link format, no `pin` support.
- `POST /issuer/preauth?<query..>`: to obtain a pre-authorized code with a specific `type`, `pin` and `user_id`.

- `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration`: to obtain the OIDC configuration.
- `GET /jwks`: to obtain JWKs used by the server.

- `POST /token`: to exchange the pre-authorized code by an access token.
- `POST /credential`: to issue a credential, requires `Authorization` provided by the previous step.

## Planned improvements

- Add JSONLD support;
- Add more configuration options;
  - Supported credential types;
  - Access token expiration time;
- External credential provider to easily change the hard-coded `OpenBadgeCredential`;

## Running

### `.env`

A `.env` file must be created with the following variables:

```bash
ISSUER=http://localhost:9000
JWK='{"kty":"OKP","crv":"Ed25519","x":"<redacted>","d":"<redacted>"}'
JWE_SECRET=<redacted>
```

The `ISSUER` will be used to fill the `oidc-configuration` endpoint and
inside the credential in the `.issuer.url` field.

The `JWK` will be used to create a DID and sign the credentials.

There are several ways to create your JWK. There are online tools, 
but those are of course not feasible for production use. Another way is to use [`jwk-generator`][], 
```bash
java -jar json-web-key-generator.jar -t EC -c P-256 -u sig
```
or openssl with a pem-jwk converter.

The `JWE_SECRET` will be used to support PIN enabled Issuance Request,
this password will be used with `PBES2_HS512_A256KW` `JWE` encryption.

### `docker-compose`

The `docker-compose` file can be used to run the required Redis instance.

```bash
docker compose up -d redis
```

If you want to point to a different instance of Redis, you can add the 
URL to the following variable in the `.env` file:

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1/
```

### Rust nightly

The `rust-toolchain.toml` file is configured to use Rust `nightly`.

If that doesn't work, you can add the override manually with:

```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

### `Rocket.toml`

In the `Rocket.toml`, you can change the port that the server will use as shown below:

```toml
[debug]
port = 8080
```

For more information on other server options provided by `Rocket` please refer to its documentation.

### Run rocket
Once the database instance is up and running you have to start the Rocket-based web service itself:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Example Usage

The following commented bash script is an example of the format and calls made to this issuer.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Change URL according to the server you're testing with
url=http://localhost:9000

# If `uuidgen` is not present in your environment, just substitute by a hardcoded value

uuid=`uuidgen`

preauth=$(curl -s -X POST $url/issuer/preauth\?type\=OpenBadgeCredential\&user_id\=$uuid)

# This requires `jq` to extract the `access_token` value from the JSON, could be done manually or in other ways
access_token=$(curl -s -X POST $url/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code&pre-authorized_code=$preauth"\
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# Replace `proof.jwt` to one generated by your client.
# In this example, the `jwt` uses `did:key:z6MkwEGcHQYdp8dfiM34VSnEdVRMF9TNRECnhvbRHPCBqQr9`
# has a `http://localhost:9000` audience and a one year duration to facilitate testing.
# THEY ARE NOT INTENDED AS EXAMPLE PRODUCTION VALUES
# `type` and `format` might differ if working with other issuers.
# Only `jwt` is supported for `proof.proof_type` at the moment.
